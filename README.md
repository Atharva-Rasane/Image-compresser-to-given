# Image-compresser-to-given
This is actually a result of an over reaction to github's 1mb profile size limit, resulting in a program that can adjust the quality of image and the size to get the required size
----
> # How to use:
> - Select the file through the open menu.
> - Set the file size.
> - Press Save and compress.

----
> # How it works:
> - its a while loop which resizes the image and reduces the quality until its equal or just below the required size.

----
> # Requirements:
> - Python.
> - Tkinter module(Edit the code to remove it).
> - Pillow Module.
